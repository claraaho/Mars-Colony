##Project Summary
The Mars Colony app allows users to register for a colonist spot on the limited Mars habitat. To ensure community safety and an overall pleasant new life on Mars, colonists can report alien encounters and what actions they took which then can be viewed by everybody. 

##Technology 
 * HTML
 * CSS/SCSS
 * Git/Github
 * Javascript
 * Angular2
 * Postman

##Personal Learning
The Mars Colony app has been different from our projects so far in respect to posting user input data and fetching it back as well. Learning to do so was very fascinating and I thought it was really neat to be able to share input from my app to the API and be able to view data from my peers' apps with Postman. All in all it was a very fun and rewarding experience being able to build this app. 

##TODO
 * Add transitioning from page to page
 * Wordpress stretchgoal
 * Add variables and mixins (SASS it up)
